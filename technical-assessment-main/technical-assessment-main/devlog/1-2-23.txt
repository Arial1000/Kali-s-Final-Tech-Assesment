Today's Goals:
Finsih Devlog, essays, and upload work to repository and turn in alll work. Merge my work to tech-assesment.






Overall Summary:
I am so glad to have applied to this position and I am so thankful to be given this opportunity. I learned so much more than
I thought I would from simply applyin to a job! This tech-assesmnet truly showed me that I can learn so much in a week
if I know where to look and if I know how to manage my time. Although I truly wish I had been abel to get further with this
project, I am proud of myself for learning basic knowledge on three programming languages I was unfamiliar with an learning
the basics of gitHub and creating my first ever webpage! 

The knowledge I gained from just this tech-assesment is truly invaluable on my journey as a software developer and has changed
the way I see research and they way in which I will manage my tinme. Now I know that when sonething is brand new to me,
I learn better from videos rather than articles, but if it is sowthing I am faniliar with, then artiscles can help me brush up.
I also learned it is better not to rush and go in the proper order, so you really unnderstand what you are doing.
With the knowledge I learned about gitHub, I can go back to the other students in the GameDesign club and teach them how to 
do it too, since so many were like me and confused by it. 

I plan to continue working on what I learned and on this project and getting the routing on my website working post this 
assesment. I am not one to stop learning and figuring things out. Given more time I am positive I can have this website
running properly. With programming thing always come together in the end. There's an answer somewhere!

Thank you again for the opportunity and I hope you had a wonderful holiday! I look forward to hearing from you.
