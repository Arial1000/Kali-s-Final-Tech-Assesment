Today's Goals:
Watch Tutorials on Youtube about HTML, CSS, and Type Script. Create own version of frontend tasks.

Today's Summary:

While the tutorials on Angular were helpful with seeing the big picture and what the assignment is asking of me and what
the program should look like when it is done. The tutorial was definitely made for someone who is already fluent in HTML,
CSS, and TypeScript. I knew almost nothing about any of those languages. These vidoes definitely helped me get a basic grasp
for each language. I learned that you use <h1><h1/> for headings and <p><p/> for pargraphs. You use<img> for images. Html is
used to define content and css styles content. <div> defines divisions in your website or app. You have to link HTML and CSS 
together using 

      <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="app.component.css"/>

With CSS I learned about changing the font and color of the text and the alignment of the text.

I started on tutorials for TypeScript, but out of the three languages TypeScript is by far the most complex. I understood a 
little more about creating functions in TypeScript and how variables in TypeScript don't change type. 

Then, I started coding my version of the front end. I only used what I fully grasped and resources that helped me to actually
understand what to do. Although the Angular tutorial was nice and straight forward, it never explained things on a level
where I could recreate the same app independently. This also hinders my own creativity and problem solving process. 
It also doesnt allow me to show what I learned or know for the tech assesment. So, I decided to do my own from the knowledge
I was able to grasp within a week. I created a title and a navigation page with links. I understand how the routing is 
supposed to work and I tried to get it to work, but unfortunately I ran out of time to solve why it is not working. However,
if given more time, I am positive I would be able to figure out why it wasn't working. Note: I was using a sepparate Angular
application all together to run my work so my code could compile without conflicting with the given code. I will merge them
together later.
